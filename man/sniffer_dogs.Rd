\details{
When the alien invasion comes we'll need spaniels (or possibly other dogs, but lets hope its mainly spaniels because spaniels are cool)
to help us to identify the space lizards. The top-secret government agency for Training Extra-terrestrial Reptile Detection (TERD) was put together
to test the plausibility of training sniffer dogs to detect aliens. Over many trials 8 of their best dogs (Milton, Woofy, Ramsey, Mr. Snifficus III,
Willock, The Venerable Dr. Waggy, Lord Scenticle, and Professor Nose) were recruited for a pilot study. During training, these dogs were rewarded
for making vocalisations while sniffing alien space lizards (which they happened to have a few of in Hangar 18).
On the test trial, the 8 dogs were allowed to sniff 4 entities for 1-minute each: an alien space lizard, a shapeshifting alien space
lizard who had taken on humanoid form and worked undetected as a statistics lecturer, a human, and a human mannequin). The number of vocalisations made
during each 1-minute sniffing session was recorded. For more alien lizard and sniffer dog adventures see \link{alien_scents}.
\itemize{
\item \strong{dog_name}: the name of the sniffer dog
\item \strong{entity}: the entity being sniffed by the sniffer dog (alien, alien in humanoid form (shapeshifter), human, human mannequin)
\item \strong{vocalisations}: the number of vocalisations made by the dog during a 1-minute sniff
